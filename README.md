# menu-to-cross-icon
One idea, 6 possibilities

---

The project Menu-to-cross-icon is a project made to show people different ways to create a "Menu icon" that switch into a "cross icon" ( ☰ -> ✖ ) . 

Some technics use vanilla javascript, some uses jQuery and some are powerd by CSS only!

## Few secrets 
- No matter where you are on the page, clicking the code brackets icon, will vertically center the page into your browser.
- Clicking the codepen icon when the code snippet zone is open, will generate a new pen containing the code snippet, you will be able to play with it.
- Pressing the up/down arrows, will get you to the next/previous section.
